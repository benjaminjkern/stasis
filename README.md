# What is Stasis?
Stasis is a static semantic analyzer and code "hyper linter".


### Things Stasis can (will be able to) do
- Analyze your code and tell you about any potential problems it will have BEFORE running it
- Return multiple errors rather than just the first error that happens
- Tell you whenever you change your code exactly what will break (if anything) across the stack
